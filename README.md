# omokami's brew tool

#### this program:

- keeps track of all of your known brew recipes in a yaml file
- lets your quickly reference them within the program using a fuzzy search
- creates concurrent timers using dbus notification system
- has a clean little cli menu which doesn't look obnoxious

#### who is this for?

CivMC brewers but any brew mod users can use the basic template.  
the default provided yaml file just won't apply to you.

#### planned features

- slash commands to:
    - kill specific timers, 
    - pretty print all recipe cards,
    - quit the program (currently ctrl+c)
- config file to:
    - turn on/off persistent notifications (only get a notif @ x time)
    - custom sounds at different x seconds remaining
    - custom brewfile location (currently ~/.config/brewt/brews.yaml)
